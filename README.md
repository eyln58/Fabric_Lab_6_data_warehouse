# üß† Analyzing Data in a Data Warehouse with Microsoft Fabric

This repository documents the completion of a hands-on lab focused on analyzing data within a **relational data warehouse** using Microsoft Fabric.

## üéØ Purpose of the Lab

The goal of this lab was to explore Microsoft Fabric's **data warehouse capabilities** by designing, populating, modeling, and querying structured analytical data. Unlike lakehouse-based SQL endpoints, the data warehouse in Fabric provides **full SQL support**, including INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations and advanced modeling features.

## üß† What I Learned

By completing this lab, I gained practical experience with the following concepts:

- **Creating a Fabric Data Warehouse**  
  Learned how to set up a data warehouse within a Fabric workspace and create relational database objects like tables, views, and models.

- **Schema Design and Data Loading**  
  Designed a simple dimensional model using **fact and dimension tables**, and loaded sample data using SQL scripts.

- **Data Modeling and Relationships**  
  Defined **many-to-one relationships** between tables to create a coherent analytical model. This step was key to enabling high-performance joins and intuitive report building.

- **SQL Querying for Analysis**  
  Wrote SQL queries to **aggregate sales data** by dimensions such as time and region, demonstrating the analytical power of structured models.

- **Creating Views**  
  Encapsulated business logic in views to simplify querying and support reuse.

- **Visual Query Editor**  
  Used Fabric‚Äôs **visual query builder** to merge and filter data without writing code‚Äîideal for quick insights or non-technical users.

- **Hiding Unnecessary Fields**  
  Optimized the semantic model by hiding technical fields from the report view, making the dataset cleaner and more accessible for reporting.

- **Report Building with Power BI in Fabric**  
  Built a simple report visualizing **total sales by product category**, customizing chart types and formatting for presentation.

## ‚úÖ Outcome

At the end of this lab, I had a fully functional Fabric data warehouse that included:
- A star-schema model with fact and dimension tables
- A curated semantic model for BI tools
- A published report visualizing key business metrics

This experience reinforces key data warehouse concepts while showcasing how seamlessly Microsoft Fabric integrates modeling, querying, and reporting into a single workflow.
